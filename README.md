# progress-bar
This is a really simple progress bar I made when I was taking some of my first steps into learning web design. You can change it and customize it however you like. Use something like JavaScript (or, as a test, manually change it with dev tools) to change the width of the `.xpbar` element, and it is supposed to smoothly take effect but it does not seem to be doing that. This progress bar was made to be used in [blobsgame](https://github.com/blobs-io/blobsgame), but 2018 me decided that it would be a good idea to also create a repository for it for some reason.
